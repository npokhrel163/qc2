# qc2
Simulating a quantum circuit using a quantum computer
first part is importing different modules in python
we then run the circuit in a quantum simulator using Aer.
At the end the circuit is run in an actual quantum computer.

The data shows the discrepancies in the simulated versus the actual data.
It has to do with the noise that are inherent in the build of the quantum computer.
If we don't consider for the noise then we get almost similar measurement.
